(Superposition Phase Entangled Quantum Shift State Collapse Boxed Unseen)

(the box is both pushable and unpushable)
(it switches around on each push)
(so for example it starts as l-r pushable u-d unpushable)
(then changes to l-r unpushable and u-d pushable)
(on leaving contact it changes state? you "observed" it, now it changes)
(or should be used by an activator)

(mutant giant cat that you have to feed entangled food which is inside the boxes)
(you have to put a V and H on the cat, so it can collapse into catfood and feed it)

RULES
======

(---Box logic---)

(player pushes boxes)
horizontal [ > Player | BoxH ] -> [ > Player | > BoxH ]
vertical [ > Player | BoxV ] -> [ > Player | > BoxV ] 

horizontal [ > Player | SuperBoxH ] -> [ > Player | > SuperBoxH ]
vertical [ > Player | SuperBoxV ] -> [ > Player | > SuperBoxV ] 

(when player is moving away from box, shift state)
horizontal [ < Player | BoxH ] -> [ < Player | BoxV ] sfx1
vertical [ < Player | BoxV ] -> [ < Player | BoxH ] sfx1

(when inside the BoxV, can only move horizontal)
vertical [ BoxVState > Player ] -> cancel
(when inside the BoxH, can only move vertical)
horizontal [ BoxHState > Player ] -> cancel

(phase through BoxH)
vertical [ > Player | BoxH ] -> [ | BoxHState Player ]
late vertical [ BoxHState no Player ] -> [ BoxH ] sfx0

(phase through BoxV)
horizontal [ > Player | BoxV ] -> [ | BoxVState Player ]
late [ BoxVState no Player ] -> [ BoxV ] sfx0

(creating superbox)
[ > BoxV | BoxH ] -> [ | SuperBox ]
[ > BoxH | BoxV ] -> [ | SuperBox ]

(trying to stop superbox pushing when it shouldn't make sense)
horizontal [ > SuperBox | BoxH ] -> cancel
vertical [ > SuperBox | BoxV ] -> cancel

(Superbox doesn't separate near walls)
[ > Player | SuperBox | Wall ] -> [ Player | SuperBox | Wall ]

(when player pushes superbox, it separates)
horizontal [ > Player | SuperBox | No Box  ] -> [ | BoxVState Player | BoxH ] sfx0
vertical [ > Player | SuperBox | No Box  ] -> [ | BoxHState Player | BoxV ] sfx0
(after separation, the boxpart can be pushed through multiple others)
horizontal [ > Player | SuperBox | BoxV ] -> [ | BoxVState Player | SuperBox ] sfx0
vertical [ > Player | SuperBox | BoxH ] -> [ | BoxHState Player | SuperBox ] sfx0

(cat eats player)
late [ Player CatFront ] -> [ CatFront ] sfx3
late [ Player CatBack ] -> [ CatBack ] sfx3

((superbox parts also create superboxes)
[ > SuperBoxV | BoxH ] -> [ | SuperBox ]
[ > SuperBoxH | BoxV ] -> [ | SuperBox ]

(superbox parts shouldn't exist pushable pieces)
late [ SuperBoxH ] -> [ BoxH ]
late [ SuperBoxV ] -> [ BoxV ])

message Interesting. I'll add that to my notes.
message As you have no doubt noticed...
message those boxes look interesting.
message The thing is, according to QAT expert [REDACTED]
message they are in superposition.
message Both solid and intagible.
message Completely insane if you ask me.
message But yeah, pay attention to the sides of the boxes.

message You may or may not have noticed...

message They don't shift when you pass by...
message but if you move AWAY from them perpendicularly
message that's when they shift state.
message It's very peculiar.
message We can't really explain it as of yet...
message but according to [REDACTED] we are getting close.
