RULES
======

(---Box logic---)

(player pushes boxes)
horizontal [ > Player | BoxH ] -> [ > Player | > BoxH ]
vertical [ > Player | BoxV ] -> [ > Player | > BoxV ] 

(fake boxes for first few levels)
horizontal [ > Player | SuperBoxH ] -> [ > Player | > SuperBoxH ]
vertical [ > Player | SuperBoxV ] -> [ > Player | > SuperBoxV ] 

(when player is moving away from box, shift state)
horizontal [ < Player | BoxH ] -> [ < Player | BoxV ] sfx1
vertical [ < Player | BoxV ] -> [ < Player | BoxH ] sfx1

(when inside the BoxV, can only move horizontal)
vertical [ BoxVState > PlayerIntagible ] -> cancel
(when inside the BoxH, can only move vertical)
horizontal [ BoxHState > PlayerIntagible ] -> cancel

(phase through BoxH)
vertical [ > PlayerSolid | BoxH ] -> [ | BoxHState PlayerIntagible ]
(on exiting, the box becomes BoxH again)
late vertical [ BoxHState no PlayerIntagible ] -> [ BoxH ] sfx0

(phase through BoxV)
horizontal [ > PlayerSolid | BoxV ] -> [ | BoxVState PlayerIntagible ]
(on exiting, the box becomes BoxV again)
late horizontal [ BoxVState no PlayerIntagible ] -> [ BoxV ] sfx0

(--Superbox Logic--)

(creating superbox)
[ > BoxV | BoxH ] -> [ | SuperBox ]
[ > BoxH | BoxV ] -> [ | SuperBox ]

(stop superbox pushing when it shouldn't make sense)
horizontal [ > SuperBox | BoxH ] -> cancel
vertical [ > SuperBox | BoxV ] -> cancel

(Superbox doesn't separate near walls)
[ > Player | SuperBox | Wall ] -> [ Player | SuperBox | Wall ]

(when player pushes superbox, it separates)
horizontal [ > Player | SuperBox | No Box  ] -> [ | BoxVState PlayerIntagible | BoxH ] sfx0
vertical [ > Player | SuperBox | No Box  ] -> [ | BoxHState PlayerIntagible | BoxV ] sfx0

(after separation, the halfboxes can be pushed through multiple others)
horizontal [ > Player | SuperBox | BoxV ] -> [ | BoxVState PlayerIntagible | SuperBox ] sfx0
vertical [ > Player | SuperBox | BoxH ] -> [ | BoxHState PlayerIntagible | SuperBox ] sfx0

(PlayerIntagible is able to move through multiple halfboxes)
[ > PlayerIntagible BoxVState | BoxV ] -> [ BoxV | PlayerIntagible BoxVState ]
[ > PlayerIntagible BoxHState | BoxH ] -> [ BoxH | PlayerIntagible BoxHState ]

(PlayerIntagible only exist inside boxes, otherwise PlaySolid is the main)
(allows for separate logic for dying)
late [ PlayerIntagible No States ] -> [ PlayerSolid ]

(cat eats PlayerSolid, but NOT PlayerIntagible,
so separating Superbox is possible over Schrödinger)
late [ PlayerSolid CatFront ] -> [ CatFront ] sfx3
late [ PlayerSolid CatBack ] -> [ CatBack ] sfx3

message You've chosen or been chosen
message to help us [REDACTED] this [REDACTED].

message Your task is to collapse.
message Not yourself, but cat food.
message It's a bit confusing, we know.
message Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.

message Okay, so... we had a little incident with the [REDACTED].
message Nothing too major, but our office cat...
message she's fine, she's just... (calculating)
message 1.97482 times your size.
message But everything is under control.
message What you need to do is feed her.
message You'll see some boxes around. They are full of cat food.
message But due to the [REDACTED], the boxes are acting weird.

message You'll see what I mean.
message Please push the boxes to the cat.
message She'll take care of the rest.

message But word of advice... don't get too close to her, okay?

message As you have no doubt noticed, the boxes look interesting.
message According to QAT expert [REDACTED], they are in superposition.
message Both solid and intagible. Completely insane, if you ask me.
message But yeah, pay attention to the sides of the boxes.

message You may or may not have noticed...
message but you can change the STATE of the boxes.
message They don't shift when you pass by...
message but if you move AWAY from them perpendicularly
message that's when they change state.
message It's very peculiar.

message Even though Schrödinger became a giant, two boxes should be enough.
message We don't want her to become fat too.
message Also, when you are inside a box...
message you should be safe from Schrödinger.
message Just so you know. Could come in handy.
